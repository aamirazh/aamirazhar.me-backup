analysis of this article: https://shaykhatabekshukurov.com/2016/06/14/islamic-law-homosexuality-and-the-pulse-massacre/
basically it is saying this:

There are only three opinions about the punishment of homosexuals (and the accepted one is the first BTW);
Taâ€™dheer (authentic opinion of Abu Hanifa)
Punishment of adultery (the opinion of Abu Yusuf, Muhammad, Hasan etc)
Death penalty regardless (the opinion of Malik and Laith)

-same "problem" of tolerating but not homosexuality as an act
-at the very least islam privatizes sex, and just addresses homosexuality specifically
-public sphere etc
