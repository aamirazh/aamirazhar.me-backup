when light angels gay
give heeding way
dark demons overthrow

when love’s dying scent
starts to relent
souls mourn in stoic woe

when hope's distant cries,
are set on fire,
cold hearts will whisper why

then depression’s hair
will start to flare
her lust has come alive.

her skin so soft, but her rule aloft,
Plays her victims like a game.

Her alluring gaze, her warm embrace,
Puts great men in worthless shame.

-depression is beautiful, smooth skin, fair skin, soft lips, very comfortable
-her "henchmen" are demons, they wreak havoc while she seduces
-this poem was done in 2013, most of it on the night of september 9, then edited a bit the night of october 13
