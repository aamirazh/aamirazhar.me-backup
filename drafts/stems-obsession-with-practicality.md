STEM's obsession with practicality

-create a strawman
--white guy in his mid 20s, grew up in silicon valley, fairly wealthy but listens to enough NPR to recognize his privilege. doesnt like politics so hes thinking about voting 3rd party this election

-STEMs are huge on being practical
--source of superiority over liberal artsy people (humanities)
--why study inequality when you can lessen it by selling your labor and donating proceeds to charity
--technically you did more than a humanities kid could ever do, right?
--the answer is yes, you're doing more than humanities kids could do, but that's because you've completely accepted a framework and humanities kid didn't
--so you're doing more within the framework than humanities kid, and i think humanities kid knows that

-problem lies within the complacent, "comfortable" version of social justice that comes with this acceptance of the current system of how things work
--for example, though donating to charities are definitely useful and make practical progress, rarely do they actually address (or question, or even attempt to understand) the fundamental reasons for the poverty and for the need of charities to keep things going in the first place. in fact this whole charity culture, while cute, does nothing to counter if not reinforce the power system of wealth inequality

-this is why this archetype are engineers
--almost by definition it works within the system
--the act of engineering is to create solutions after you're given a set of assumptions, tools, and structures
--this is why we don't feel bad when we donate to charities, but from wages that rely on exploiting third world factory workers and aiding power-hungry companies that want to control the world's information -- because that's just the way the world works right now

-so while STEM's obsession with progress can be a good one, it's also one that only sees progress within our current framework (straight-line progress, rather than revolution). and STEM can be so hellbent on being practical that it is unable to critically analyze fundamental assumptions and structures that our system is formed upon, despite the fact that understanding the viability of "practical" solutions while de and reconstructing our system together would be very powerful

-and this is exactly why the STEM type can be so allergic to critical theory, humanities, etc.
--and this framework assumption also motivates the allergy of the STEM archetype to any "radical" ideas that approach change from outside our framework
---change that is within our framework is ok, change that is outside is not
---e.g. protests that are mildly inconveniencing are not ok, such as the allen building protests, some black lives matter traffic protests, etc. however signing a petition to convince obama that BLM is ok because it's peaceful and a solution inside our framework
---STEM-mers believe working at google makes the world a better place, they believe in achieving a degree/education/resume to do so (even if these requirements are super imbalanced/unequally accessible), they believe in *working within the system to change it*. but anything more radical, more straightforward, more anarchist, any dismantling of social structures, that stuff is too out there
