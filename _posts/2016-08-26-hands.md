my hands

are scarred

by the gnawing of anxiety

and the loneliness of thought

<br>
my hands

have memories

so surreal

yet so honest
{::comment}
palpable -> tactile, honest ?
{:/comment}

<br>
they ask:

do you not experience us?
{::comment}
experience -> identify, feel, empower ?, believe
i want a word like "sense" but more powerful, like a deep sense of feeling (verb). like vehement but verb

have you touched something so soft

that your skin wants to melt

and grow into it?

have you felt something so deeply

that your skin receptors fire electricity

straight into the core of your heart?

have you touched someone so close

that the laws of physics give way

and atomic repulsion is mythicized?
{::comment}
mythicized -> becomes a myth, disappears
{:/comment}

have you grazed

the goosebumps on her arm

while you watch her speak?

have you felt her heart beat

while she stares so deeply

into your soul?

have you loved someone so infinitely

that you can feel it

from the grave?
{::comment}
infinitely -> immensely, boundlessly, limitlessly
{:/comment}

<br>
will you ever?
