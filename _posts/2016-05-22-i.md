## `Who am I?`

a blurry face on the late night subway

a timid smile in the classroom hallway

a soldier who can't fight anymore

a lover who has never loved before

{::comment}
Things that characterize me.

## `What am I?`

the loose piece of thread on a uniform

the smell of pavement after a storm

the tear down the cheek after Valentine's day

the glimpse of a child in merciless warfare

{::comment}
Simple images that imply a story, or a feeling.

## `Where am I?`

in the local bar on a weekday night

in a body which doesn't really feel right

in a world that has been plagued with war

in a home that is not home anymore

{::comment}
discomfort

## `When am I?`

the hours after the test is collected

the days before the tumor's detected

the minutes after the anxiety hits

the seconds before the very first kiss

{::comment}
Bittersweet moments, or confused/anxious moments
{:/comment}

## `Why am I?`

because of a strong and unexplained passion

because of those that dared to imagine

because of the loves that were lost and re-found

because of stories lost, yet still so profound

{::comment}
What gives me passion

## `How am I?`

I am exhausted, yet committed

I am zealous, yet submitted

I am wholehearted, yet encrypted

I am vehement.. yet unrequited
