> You're captives of a civilizational system that more or less compels you to go on destroying the world in order to live.

This is a short review of the book *Ishmael: An Adventure of the Mind and Spirit*. You can get it on Amazon <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ishmael-Adventure-Spirit-Daniel-Quinn/dp/0553375407">here</a>. I originally posted this review on Goodreads, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1735792905">here</a>.

Ishmael was an enlightening book that provided a detailed perspective and philosophy to aid me in my journey of examining the world and my relation to it. It was a neat, thought-out, and compelling critique of our civilization as we know it.

Vague words aside, all this book really is is a conversation, or rather a lesson. The book revolves around two characters, Ishmael (the teacher) and the narrator (the student). Ishmael teaches this student the nature of the modern world, the humans' relation to it, and how these came to be. As you can guess, the reader is supposed to feel like the student throughout this book, and I sure as hell did.

Though I don't completely agree with all the messages and implications of the book, it helped me contextualize a lot of my observations about the deteriorating world around us (and how exactly humans are to blame for it). Some may say it is a critique of capitalism, but it goes deeper than that; for me, it is a critique of the very assumptions and mindsets that created our capitalism, along with the contradictory modern systems we have/had, that they are as innovative and groundbreaking as they are destructive and doomed.

It's hard to describe this book in a few paragraphs because this book describes a mindset, and the best way to understand it (and its relation to you/the world around you) is simply to read it. I would highly recommend you do so.

But overall, awesome book. Fairly short (only ~250 pages) but well worth the read. It causes you to question your own assumptions about the world, and wonder how exactly to dismantle the oppressive and destructive systems we have built so elegantly. I left the book feeling impassioned but also lonely and confused, as if I wanted my own Ishmael to stay with me and tell me what to do with these new ideas and beliefs. The book is frustratingly open-ended in that sense, in that if leaves the reader to do what they will with this information. As for me, I don't know yet -- I'm just a kid :x

If I get the time, I might try to develop my thoughts and write a follow-up blog post that is less about the book and more about its ideas and how they relate to me. If you do find yourself reading this book, please feel free to contact me; I would love to discuss its ideas with you.
