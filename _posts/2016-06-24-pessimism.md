So, the UK just decided to leave the EU. I know it's been a major discussion point for the UK for a while, but as an American, it just seemed to happen so fast. And worse yet, the debate escalated further through this neoliberal, nationalist, and populist rhetoric and the whole thing just feels very uncomfortable to me.

Though I loathe Nigel Farage, it's not just Leave that's the problem. Even Remain's main argument point was an economic one, and counter-arguments for Leave's xenophobic arguments simply did not exist. Everyone seemed to hate the EU so much that the question was, "What's best for Britain?" The question was, "Does accepting refugees actually help **us**?" The question was, "At this given point in time, is the EU actually beneficial to **us**?"

And it's understandable, I guess. Britain's history with the EU has been largely one of self-interest - When it seemed against its own self-interest, it refused to join. Only when it seemed to be beneficial for the UK did they join.

But the whole thing is just messed up. Does no one realize the immense ramifications of something like this? Does no one realize the cover this has given to far-right nationalism, and the inspiration this will give to other nationalists in Europe? Is anyone even thinking about the refugees? Does no one realize just the level of neoliberalism, of individualism, of straight up fear-mongering that is going on?

> ...and in the end, Britain, which had colonized the world, destroyed itself in fantasies that it was being colonized in turn.

I honestly just don't know what to think. Lots of the rhetoric that has been behind this has just been scary, and it's proven that this rising right-wing xenophobia is not just Republican, it's not just American, and it's possibly not even just Western (though its origins may be). What does this mean for the rest of the world?

And now Nigel Farage, leader of the right-wing populist UK Independence Party has gotten so much power and traction. I don't know enough about British politics to compare, but he reminds me of the conservativism of Ted Cruz, with the populism of Trump.

I don't know. I really don't. But I'm just scared. Things are getting increasingly worrisome and nasty, and I just don't know what to do about it. This isn't just about Brexit anymore, it's about this nasty stench in the air, this unrest that seems to be growing, this division that seems to be getting more and more violent. And sentiment in Brexit has contributed to it. Is this vibe one of war? One of revolution? One of violence? Or will it somehow die down and be silenced? What is it?

You know.. it's just such a hard time to grow up. It's a hard time to swallow reality. In just this past year I've learnt so much about politics, society, and ideology, and I know I'm not done learning. But instability looms, and hate is growing like a deathly fire, and I just don't know what to do about it. How can I, a 19 year old, do anything to stop this? How can I, a dreamer, deal with all this shit? The worst seems inevitable, and I just feel so helpless. I feel like a.. pessimist. And I hate this feeling.

Now I'm privileged, and I've always felt far enough from these political shake-ups to not be struck emotionally. But, I'm feeling closer and closer to it. It feels like less of an idea and more of a reality the more I experience this, and the more I grow up. So, will they start coming for me? I mean, they already are, right? I'm a person of color, I'm Muslim, but I've been privileged enough to ignore the baggage with that until recently. But, now, I've been feeling so unsafe.. so uncertain. What is life going to be like for me in 10 years? What will it be like for my close and extended friends and family? And we don't even have it bad! What about those who are even more marginalized, even more exploited and attacked?

I choose to hope. And I will continue fighting. But I feel like I've changed. Things like this are a push into to a barren field of cold, harsh, ugly reality. Everything seems like it sucks, and that it's getting worse. I feel pessimistic. And I feel helpless.

I understand why parents try so hard to safeguard their children's innocence and protect them from the realities of the world. It's partially out of a nostalgia for one's own innocent, childish optimism, and partially out of the belief that fostering that is maybe one of our only chances out of here.

May God help us all.
