### destiny is not a love story

<br>
it is not the bright light

at the end of the tunnel

<br>
it is not the dramatic miracle

when you need it the most

<br>
it is not the dream

that fights its way into reality

<br>
it is not the spirit

of the underdog success story

<br>
it is not the warm, tired hug

that makes it all right in the end

<br>

### destiny is a surrendered sigh

<br>
it is a brush of the shoulders

with a stranger on the sidewalk

<br>
it is a leaf adrift

still and alone

<br>
it is when you wonder what went wrong

though you know it was doomed from the start

<br>
it is a slow night

where you don't want to sleep

and face the world in the morning

<br>
it is a goodbye at the train station

where you stare into each other's eyes

as you inch further and further away

<br>
it is when you convince yourself to try

only to regret it again.
