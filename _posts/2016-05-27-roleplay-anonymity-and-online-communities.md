This post is about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/05/26/neverwinter-nights-erotic-server/">this article by Steven Messner</a>, titled "A Naïf In Neverwinter Nights: Exploring Roleplay In An Erotic Fantasy Server".

I just finished reading this piece, and I enjoyed it much more than I thought I would. It was insightful, honest, and human. If you don't want to read it, it's about erotic roleplay in a Neverwinter Nights server, which is a (mostly dead) game all the way from 2002.

I'm going to start with a quick runthrough of the article and the parts I found intriguing behind it. If you want to read just my personal story and reflections relating to this piece, feel free to skip down below the last quote.

The author talks about being a newcomer in this community, trying to make his way around. Understandably, it's another universe to him, with its own social norms, seemingly weird practices, and ways of expression.

> I have no idea how I’m supposed to talk or act. Do I just speak normally? Do I have to invent some mannerisms for Joren to use? I’m an alien in a sitcom about infiltrating human society for which I have no understanding, only no one is laughing.

However, he soon finds out things aren't so bad after all. People are nice and seemingly supportive, and he finds he's actually enjoying socializing in this universe and forming social connections. Note that at this point, he hasn't done anything sexual yet. He's examining purely the social structure of this community and the way that people interact.

> It’s at this point that I realize my expectations for this server are likely wildly different than the truth. When I arrived, I thought I was walking into a kind of Sodom. I imagined a place where every street was filled with naked characters utilizing the custom emotes contained in the 15 gigabytes of extra content I downloaded to have lurid sex on these virtual streets. But Sinthara is actually a rather pleasant place to be. Characters stop and chat idly with one another, using asterisks to emote body language too subtle for Neverwinter Night’s engine to display. If it wasn’t for the fact that many of them were half-naked demons of some variety, Sinthara would feel more like a cozy village than a den of depravity

Anyway, later on in the story, he meets this girl and talks to her. They end up talking and chilling, almost as if they were on a first date. He and the girl actually click together and talk quite a bit, staying up to almost 5am. It was a short interaction, just lasting one night, and they won't see each other again (since he won't be coming onto the server anymore), but it ended up making a lasting impact on him.

> I understand now that our avatars aren’t a mask meant to hide who we are. It is, in some small but significant way, a window to our raw self – that same awkward, vulnerable self I haven’t felt since I was a teenager nervously peeling off my clothes in front of someone I cared about. The masks Aria and I wear and the characters we play aren’t the foundations of a lie. They are a trust we share to not betray the other—to not suddenly point and laugh at the shitty portrait they’re holding up

Besides the great writing and honest narrative, I found myself empathizing a lot when reading this article, and not in a weird way. See, I myself grew up using online communities similar to this one for social support and community. I didn't do it because I was lonely -- ok, maybe I was a little, but that's besides the point. I kind of just started playing video games and then I met people and started forming social relationships. I grew quite attached to my friends online and frequently have nostalgia about them, wondering where they are in life and if we'll ever meet again.

I feel awfully connected to them, though I only spent a little part of my life with them, and both of us were hiding behind anonymous identities. I even claimed, at some points in my "online life", that my name was "Matt", and I was 16 (at the time, I was 12). My skin was also white, which is another interesting thing I felt compelled to do, but that's another story. The point is that we each were hiding behind these online personalities yet we still felt some sort of connection to each other through that. It was kind of beautiful, now that I think about it. How people manage to find each other and become close in the weirdest situations -- and yet, we still have trouble connecting to each other as humans even in more "natural" settings.

I remember playing on an old MapleStory server two summers ago, to relive that kind of experience I had when I was maybe 12 years old. Turns out, the majority of people on this server were doing the same exact thing, college students and adults who played the game as kids and wanted to escape back to it for a little while. I instantly got hooked and formed great relationships. I made a guild, spent time with people, and talked honestly about life a lot. I was different, I was 6 years older, I was about to go to college for fucks sake, but I still felt the same kind of community, social comfort, and frankly, addiction. Long story short, I had a great time but had to quit before college started since I was way too addicted. I added lots of my online friends on Skype, and a couple on Facebook, and we talked occasionally, though we began to lose touch eventually. I still miss it, though. There's something about that kind of environment that fosters genuine social interaction.

This is more of a personal struggle than an online one, in which I hate losing touch with people. But the point is, I cared more about these relationships I formed online than many of my real life relationships. And that's because I felt more comfortable with them, more honest, and more *real*.

I know it was an online community, and I know probably half the people there weren't who they said they were. But, it was so **honest**, and people were so genuine. All the bullshit of real life socializing was gone. If someone wanted to talk to you, they would really talk to you, and if they didn't, they would walk away and you would never know who they were. It's weird, online was kind of a filter for people to actually feel comfortable being real with others without real life repercussions. Without worrying if your online friends would tell other people, or if they would judge you, or if romantic complications would surface.

I identify a lot with online culture and it's been a part of my life, being instrumental in my growth as a kid. I think I still share the same social insecurities, frustrations, and tendencies as I did 5-10 years ago, and that's why I still feel nostalgia about it.

I'm an honest person, and I like having meaningful, genuine connections to people.. and ironically, despite "how far I've come", I still see that more in online communities than I can find in real life. In fact, after so long, and after so many social experiences in real life, I still want to go back sometimes.
