As some of you know, I started my study abroad semester in Amman, Jordan, last week. I wanted to write down updates every week (ideally) just to get my thoughts down/feelings out as well as to keep people in the loop while I'm gone.

***NOTE:*** These diary-esque entries are really all over the place and not structured -- If you want a concise tl;dr, skip to the end (Conclusions/Summary), unless you really want to read a jumbled stream of consciousness. Anyway, here goes:

## Original Thoughts

So, I arrived in Jordan feeling pretty anxious, which I was surprised about. I normally love travelling and absolutely adore flying and planes, but I found myself restless on the plane, really lonely, and already a little homesick. This was partially for personal reasons, but mostly because I already spent 3 months away from Duke, lots of my friends, and my family, and I finished my internship ready to go back to Duke with a new (and more mature) mindset, both in terms of approaching my relationships as well as my interests, academic or otherwise. And so it sucked to kind of have to re-uproot myself after a few days at Duke and send myself abroad, alone, independent, and in a new environment yet again..

<br>
That was my mindset going in (and somewhat my mindset now). I was feeling anxious, thinking maybe this was a mistake, but my logical side was telling me that objectively this was a good decision, and so I still believed that. As much as it was tough leaving, I don't think I'd have a better time to study abroad, forget about everything else, and be able to just focus on my Arabic and maybe a personal project or two. A battle of the heart and mind, if you will.

Orientation week strengthened these feelings, just because it was a lot of meeting new people and a lot of unknowns, meaning that I didn't know how this semester would be, I didn't know who to spend it with, and I didn't know if I'd approach it right -- I'm really dependent on my environment and on my peers and this was both a big deal but also something I didn't want to force or put too much energy into. I dislike large group settings so I found myself just walking or sitting alone a lot during orientation, which --side note-- I was proud of. I used to feel guilty for that because I'd be missing out on getting to know new potentially awesome people, but I was more comfortable in my introversion and was no longer a naive freshman during O-week.

Anyway, the downside of that was that I felt lonely during nights, and though I made a few friends, I didn't seem very close to them in terms of what I wanted out of this semester. I wanted more tangible things, like maybe a documentary project, a social project, and almost-fluency in Arabic. Others seemed like they wanted to practice Arabic, but they mostly just wanted to have fun, talk to Jordanians, and ~understand the culture~. If it helps, maybe 90% of the program is white, and I felt like I just didn't have the same approach to the program that many of them did. However, this feeling I had, which I still can't grasp very well, led to a really interesting conversation I had with a fellow POC I met later in orientation, which I wrote an incomplete blog post on. It was specifically about why white people/Americans abroad love spending time with children from other countries (e.g. refugee kids) but less more "hardened" or "jaded" adults. Anyway, I won't go on that tangent, but keep an eye out if you're intrigued about it, or ask me about it.

## Midweek/Developed Thoughts

In the middle of orientation week, I got pretty lucky. I was walking back from the supermarket towards the cafe with other people from the program, and this Korean girl in the group named Hans approached me and started talking to me. Mind you, I was tired that day and had enough socializing, but I could tell during introductions that she was interesting and so I reciprocated the interest. We introduced ourselves, and in the cafe she told me she was interested in post-colonial studies and she did a photography project over the summer in Jakarta about villages/"Kampungs" (if you know Behasa) that the government was trying to evict to make way for modernization. This prompted a nice discussion between me, her, and two people about modernization, capitalism, and colonization. I liked it because it was a directed conversation (not vague like "I like studying abroad cause I like experiencing new cultures"), a relevant one, and an impassioned one.

Me and Hans ended up building our friendship off of this, and we both shared with each other what we wanted out of this semester and ended up feeling very similarly. This gave me great hope, and we agreed to spend a lot of time together this semester, just trying to work on our Arabic, talk to people, and pursue a meaningful project or two (like a documentary). Hans is a super directed and ambitious person, so I was happy to meet her because I need people like that in my life who push me. Even now, she would go out of her way to talk to Jordanians, explore Jordan, practice Arabic, and pursue projects, and it makes me uncomfortable sometimes (see: introversion/social energy), but I'm very happy I have her to guide me because I can get shy and fairly stationary especially in new/unfamiliar environments. She also had a mutual friend named Kevin and I got along with him well, and I had my roommate and his friend to hang out with too, so I started feeling more comfortable socially.

<br>
It was also during this time that I decided to uninstall social media from my phone and try to be more independent. It just seemed like a good time - It would make sure I stick to an Arabic mindset, it'd make me less dependent on spending my free time chatting to keep me satisfied/comfortable, and most of all it'd help remove some of my anxiety about messaging and social media (and how unorganic the whole thing is). Taking this step felt a bit dramatic, but good.

With all that, I started to become more optimistic towards the end of orientation week, because I felt like I found the people I want to hang out with this semester, and I was starting to form concrete goals/projects to work on with Hans, and though it'd be exhausting, I felt more directed and ambitious. I also started walking around more with them, and it was really nice just going through downtown and seeing things with people, instead of being in my room alone.

## End of Week/Closing Thoughts

Then, the language pledge came. If you don't know the language pledge, it's a thing Middlebury does where you promise to speak Arabic as much as possible, generally meaning only Arabic when you're hanging out with other students, only Arabic in classes, and only Arabic when you're out and about. I was a bit scared about this because I just started building good friendships and now I would have to build them in a language I wasn't super comfortable with. And even the program directors admitted this, that conversations get a bit more shallow once everyone switches to Arabic and it takes a lot more energy to talk to people, even if you're close. (I wasn't very excited about that because I need social sources that give me energy/motivation and I need meaningful conversations to keep me going.)

After the language pledge, it wasn't too bad, in that I didn't mind conversing with people and I managed to not have the same conversation over and over again, but it was still really really exhausting. I had to take more time to walk/sit alone and sometimes I just didn't want to put in the effort to express my thoughts on something (which is expected). So, some of my anxiety/loneliness came back because of this social exhaustion, but at least I felt like I was getting something out of it, or I had a goal, you know?

<br>
Then, classes started (just today, on a Sunday), and I quickly got even more overwhelmed. My classes are harder than I thought they'd be, and the homework is more challenging than I expected. I mean, I expected rigor because it's Middlebury (that's why I did this program specifically), but it kind of hit me that I wouldn't be able to dictate how I wanted to spend my time during all my afternoons/evenings and that I'd actually have to worry about homework and all. It just sucked because I started getting excited about doing all these projects, and about exploring Jordan, and though I'm still trying to make time for it, I didn't expect to feel that classroom/student lifestyle today, and it made everything more grey and busy work oriented.

It's worth saying that I'm in no way against classes, I just learn best outside of structured contexts like classrooms and homework, and I was disappointed because I was figuring out how I'd learn that way, only to realize I had to give half my energy to learning the other way. That said, classes are only 4 days a week, so if I spend my time wisely and do all my homework those 4 days, I can hopefully at least spend 43% of my week doing other stuff.

Anyway, I felt a bit overwhelmed today because there's so much I want to do, and so much I have to do, and I don't have an established routine or schedule to know what to expect from either. I'm hoping to create that over time here in Jordan, and maybe get more comfortable, less lonely, and start meaningful projects/goals to get me motivated. Until then, it may be a bit tough for me :(

## Conclusions/Summary

Overall, it's been a super up and down week. I've just had a lot to digest (information, classes, potential projects), a lot to feel (meeting people, figuring out what I want, homesickness), and a lot to think about (from lots of time alone and independent by nature of being abroad and without close friends/family).

I came into the program anxious and homesick already after 3 months of being away doing an internship. Orientation was okay but I didn't bother spending too much social energy, so I was originally unsure about who I'd hang out with, and who I could do projects with, or even what I'd get out of the program. My worst case was I'd end up just being an independent full-time student here and waiting for the 3 months to end.

Midway through the week, though, I met a couple of great people, and one person in particular who seemed to share my feelings and goals. We agreed to hang out a lot this semester, and I was grateful because I need at least one person to rely on and who can encourage/push me. I felt optimistic randomly, because I was starting to form ideas and goals and feeling like I could get something tangible and meaningful out of my time here.

Then, classes started and exhaustion kicked in. Exhaustion has been here the whole time, but I no longer have evenings/nights to relax since now I have homework to balance and more stuff on my mind. Classes made me a bit anxious again because I realized I wouldn't have as much time an energy to explore, talk to people organically, and pursue projects as I planned to in orientation week (before classes started). That said, I think I just need a good routine and a better feel as to how things are going, and then I can feel more confident in how I spend my time. Also, I need this homesickness to mellow out a bit and just for me to find my mojo.

<br>
So, yeah, closing thoughts:

* This whole semester is going to be exhausting, I know it. This can be good or bad, depending on if I can get meaningful/tangible stuff from it. But even just only talking in Arabic is draining enough so far, notwithstanding my classwork, figuring out my goals/projects, and my anxiety.

* I really need a routine, I'm waiting to start getting comfortable in this new environment and with my priorities, and I'm hoping once that happens I'll feel less homesick and more focused.

* I'm also hoping to form better habits here, while I have the time. Stuff like sleeping enough, removing my dependence and anxiety surrounding talking to people online and social media in general, and adventuring/exploring more.

* That said, and don't take this the wrong way - I hope this semester is fast and sweet. I recognize the importance of this semester but I'm at a phase in my life where I want to build familiarity and solid ground work in my relationships, my passions, and my emotions.. and being in yet another completely new environment/context for the 3rd time in a row will be helpful and prompt growth, but exhaust me, yet again.
