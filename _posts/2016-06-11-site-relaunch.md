I just relaunched my blog today. Coding a website design from scratch is tough (and I am not a UI/UX guy), so I decided to use an external theme. It's called [Carte Noire](http://carte-noire.jacobtomlinson.co.uk/), and it's created by [Jacob Tomlinson](https://twitter.com/_JacobTomlinson). Credits go to him!! And while I'm at it, many of the thumbnail icons in this blog (like the rocket icon at the top) are by [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/). I am still using Jekyll on Github Pages, this theme is just a specific Jekyll theme that saves me countless hours trying to build a nice looking website from scratch. If you want to use the theme as well, here is the [Github link](https://github.com/jacobtomlinson/carte-noire).

Anyway, hope you enjoy! I will be blogging more often now since all this programming stuff is mostly out of the way (besides small changes I would program in). However, I am working and fasting this month (Ramadan) so posts will probably come at less frequency because of business and slight exhaustion.

Let me know if you have any feedback, and thanks for reading my blog. It means a lot :)
