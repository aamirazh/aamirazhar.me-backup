As some of you may know, I'm studying abroad this semester in Jordan to practice Arabic and explore a project or two. The study abroad program I'm with (Middlebury) is maybe 90% white this semester. And as hinted in my last blog post, sometime I feel disconnected from, or skeptical of some of the white students and their perspectives on study abroad. This is an example of that.

To illustrate this concept, I'll generalize an image a bit. So, we're all familiar with voluntourism, right? If not, it's a loose term used for Westerners (largely white but can be hyphenated Americans too) that go to an exotic 3rd world country to do volunteer work, but also to "explore" the culture and take pictures while they're there as well.

Do you ever notice that the vast majority of friendly relationships made between these Westerners and the 'natives' are with foreign children? The vast majority of the pictures are with a bunch of goofy kids, those who are missed are mostly the friendly kids, etc.

See, while I was familiar with voluntourism, I never noticed how skewed it is to foreign kids, and how meaningful relationships/conversations are rarely made with the adults there, until I actually talked about this concept with a POC friend in this program. Just in my program alone, there were so many people who wanted to work with refugees, but for some reason "preferred" refugee children. So many people who wanted to meet "real" Jordanians, but in reality only talked to young university students (most of which were also familiar with Western culture and spoke English), their host siblings, and friendly storeowners in Western malls -- never adult Jordanians who occupied spaces they didn't feel comfortable in. They were avoided because those Jordanians may be sketchy, they may seem off-limits, and they may seem less welcoming than a taxi driver who makes money off of rich Westerners.

So, why exactly this preference for kids? I'll answer that after making a quick clarification.

I only presented this occurrence with 'voluntourists', aka service workers. But the truth is that when we discuss this voluntourist archetype, we exaggerate it to distance ourselves from it and not feel guilty. In reality, this mentality is very common and all of us Westeners embody parts of it to a certain degree (even POC). And this includes not just service workers, but those studying abroad (aka my program), and even those who go from a Western country to a 3rd world country for work.

So, when reading or writing about these occurrences, I try to keep myself in mind because I am considered a Westerner. I ask that instead of distancing yourself and condemning it, search for this mentality within yourself and try to fix it.

Now, to the main question: Under this impression/assumption that Westerners prefer foreign children to foreign adults, why does this happen?

The reality lies in comfort, and in accessibility. In some ways, it's understandable. Foreign children provide a watered down, friendly, and innocent version of the culture we're trying to "understand" and "immerse" ourselves in. They don't have all of the baggage, the jadedness, and the reality of the adults. This goes especially for refugee families. Children, though they may have gone through a lot, may not completely understand the context of the war, and most don't want to bring it up. Whereas adults more often live that raw reality, have to face the political and social context, and for that reason, may even harbor some resentment against Western powers for contributing to their situation.

Kids are just easier. And even among adults, so are those nice foreigners who "love America" for its freedom, modernity, and money. In fact, in the countries I've been to there's more foreigners who idolize Western culture and treat whites as exotic than those who may resent it. But that's expected, given how globalization prefers Western civilization to any others.

But these types of people, especially the kids, allow us to enjoy another culture while forgetting about all the history, the politics, and the instability that we, by association of being Western, may have contributed to. Yes, you. And yes, me. We all play a part in reinforcing or being complacent to the power systems that kill, hurt, or simply passively colonize other countries. And we can avoid that history of imperialism, of colonization, and of orientalism when we talk to kids.

That's why being harassed for being white, introducing yourself to someone who dislikes America, or even walking through an unfamiliar, non-Westernized neighborhood can be so scary and uncomfortable. "Why do they hate us?" one may think. "Why do they treat me so differently?" another may think. But maybe these questions, albeit uncomfortable, actually do need to be contemplated on.

But, I get it. I'm not saying to approach every local, and force relationships with those who aren't as accessible or as interested in you. In fact, it's probably best to stick to those who are accessible, i.e. kids, storeowners, students, etc. I just wish we understood the hypocrisy of claiming to "experience", "understand", and "immerse" ourselves in a country, when in reality we're only exposed to the parts that are open to Westerners, that are more easy-going, that are more fun.

Now, this is approaching my own personal opinion, but I think we should do away with this whole notion of being able to experience a foreign culture, of being able to understand it, of being able to become a part of it. It's dishonest, especially because it's clear none of these ever happen, given our limited experience in any foreign country.

We have to accept our Western-ness, our whiteness (if you're white), our differences, and accept that as much as we want to learn what it's like to be a foreigner (or worse, try to become one), we never really will. What we should hope for instead is an 'alliance' of sorts, where we make mutually beneficial relationships, educate ourselves, and reflect on what we can do to dismantle the Western power system from our own contexts, while being clear to *stay in our place as Westerners*. And by stay in our place, I mean stay in our place. I mean don't speak on the culture or social issues without clarifying your Western point of view, don't try to pretend to be "one of them" (maybe pretend to be an expat instead), and for God's sake don't get annoyed if something makes you uncomfortable, like a "sketchy" neighborhood, the style of living, an anti-Western remark, or whatever.

You may say it's semantics, but I think it's important. I've seen too many people casually proclaim they want to live like [Country]-ians for a semester, who want to really "experience" a culture, who, after spending a couple of years in an Arab country, think they can stamp 'comfortable with Arab culture' on their passport, or even adopt Arab as part of their identity. Surrendering ourselves to our limits, then building upwards from that is better than building ourselves up to these Western ideals and winding up being delusional, problematic, or disappointed in the end.

*Disclaimer: This post generalizes Westerners and was mostly directed at privileged white people. Often times, your relationship with another country can be more nuanced, such as if your parents were immigrants to the US and you are trying to connect further with your heritage by going abroad. There is still a barrier by nature of being American, but depending on our situations, the context changes.*
