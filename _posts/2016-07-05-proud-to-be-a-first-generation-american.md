You know, despite being part of an immigrant family, I grew up celebrating the 4th of July fairly often. Most times, we'd drive out to the city and spend the night looking at the fireworks and feeling proud to be American. I know one night, my cousins, brothers, and I drove 2 hours to San Francisco to see the fireworks, but it was so crowded that we decided to set up behind some buildings and see them from our car. It was a great time, and one of the most fond memories I have spending time with my cousins.

This year, I didn't see the fireworks because it’s Ramadan and I decided to worship instead. But, I am still American, and to prove it, I’m writing this post.

Now, both my parents immigrated to America for their undergraduate education. My father came from Pakistan, along with the rest of his family, and my mother came from Malaysia, alone.

My father, despite graduating high school at 15 with stellar grades, couldn't find a university willing to help pay for his education because of his international status. After trying for a year or two, a small liberal arts school called Wake Forest decided to take a chance and give him a full ride. My father made literally the most of that one opportunity he was given, overloading each semester and graduating in under 3 years with a B.S. in Math and Physics. He then went on and got a PhD in Computer Science from the more renowned Duke University, then moved to and succeeded in Silicon Valley.

My mother somehow got into Carnegie Mellon with a full ride from the get go, and started off with a B.S. in Computer Science. Though she was doing it for financial security post-graduation, she never felt included in the CS crowd, and switched over to the less "STEM-y" Information Systems (see: brogrammers). She got married to my father and moved to Silicon Valley with him. She landed a good job as a computer analyst, and managed to support her family financially by working 9-5 every day, and emotionally by raising me and my brothers, working from home 1-2 times a week. How she did it, unclear. If you find out, though, do let me know.

My parents are a prime example of the American dream, the started-from-the-bottom-now-we're-here theme, the success-through-blood-sweat-and-tears motif. And frankly, I'm sure they've been used many times as an example for neoliberal white men, claiming "now this is how immigrants should be!" But, that's the thing. The most hard-working people I know are immigrants or children of immigrants. And I've seen too many people grow up in comfort, wealth, and privilege and end up not really believing in working or giving back to their country, and who embody the laziness and inactivity we Americans attribute to immigrants and minorities. And honestly, I, the American-born citizen, tend to be very critical and intolerant of American culture, while my immigrant parents tend to want to assimilate into it. I think immigrants, in many ways, are the ones most proud of and grateful for their American identity.

This has made me realize how lucky I am to be here. Just to grow up in financial security, safety, and opportunity. Just to be able to pursue my dreams without having to uproot myself out of my home country and redefine myself in an unfamiliar place (yet). Just to be able to have the flexibility to explore myself and figure out what I really want out of life without worrying where my next meal is coming from. Just to be able to be socially outspoken without risking my family's safety and means of living.

I keep thinking how every part of me that I'm proud of has been facilitated by my support and resources. My academic success I owe to my cultural and familial influence, my local school system's education, and my financial security's comfort and flexibility. My social awareness I owe to the active bay area Muslim community I was raised in, my open minded family and friends, and my ability to explore and learn. My mental and physical health I owe to my supportive parents, my helpful doctors and mentors, and to my communities and hobbies growing up. My blessings are too much to cover all here, but it took a village to raise me, and I am so grateful for all the parts of that village.

And so, overall, I am very proud to be an American. I am grateful to my American family, who cooks sandwiches and burgers as much as they cook traditional Pakistani food. I am grateful to my immigrant-majority American school systems for giving me a diverse but directed classic American education. I am grateful for my American Muslim community who can understand our legal and political system better than most "purebred" Americans. I am grateful for my Asian American friends who are as fun to play video games with as they are to talk politics with. My privilege acknowledged, America, with all its systemic problems, can be a very nice place to live, and I am grateful to live here.

Let's have a happy 4th of July. And while we celebrate, let us remember what actually makes America great -- Not its imperialism, white hegemony, or segregation, but rather its diversity, its freedom of expression, and its unity. May God bless America, and may He bless it in all the right ways.
